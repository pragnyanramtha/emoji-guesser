## About The Project

Emoji Guesser is an interactive web game where players compete to guess a secret word based on a sequence of emojis. The twist? The emoji clues are generated on-the-fly by Google's Gemini AI, making every round a unique and creative challenge.

The application is built with a modern, sleek, and responsive dark-themed UI inspired by Vercel and X.com, featuring smooth transitions and a live-updating interface.

### Core Features

*   **Real-Time Gameplay:** Uses WebSockets (via Socket.IO) for instantaneous chat and game events.
*   **AI-Generated Clues:** Integrates with the Google Gemini API to dynamically create emoji clues for random words.
*   **Dynamic User Profiles:** Users are assigned random emoji avatars that change to unique "typing" emojis (`‚úçÔ∏è`, `ü§î`, `üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è`) when they are active.
*   **Live User & Typing Indicators:** See who's online and who's currently typing a message.
*   **Flexible Answer Detection:** The game intelligently detects the correct answer even if it's part of a larger sentence.
*   **Modern, Responsive UI:** A sleek, animated landing page and a three-column game layout that looks great on all screen sizes.
*   **Word Bank:** A helpful list of possible words gives players a fighting chance.
